# PSI
Pixel Shape Index, a texture feature proposed by Prof. X. Huang, Wuhan University. Published on IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Magazine in 2017
# Notice
The results are confusing, and they are different from the results in Prof. Huang's paper.
There must be some algorithms errors latent in my codes.
# Suggestion
Download or Fork this repository ONLY when you are interested in PSI and decide to resolve the potential errors.
